DracoVM is supposed to be a stack based, compiled VM Language.

Commands supported:
(for now commands support just integers)

hypothetical STACK:
x
a
b

the RETURNS is what is left on the stack after operands have been popped
1 means true,
0 means false

COMMAND	RETURNS	COMMENT
	add	a+b	integer addition
	sub	a-b	integer subtraction
	neg	-b	integer inversion
	eq	1 or 0	equality
	gt	1 or 0 	>
	lt	1 or 0	<
	geq	1 or 0	>=
	leq	1 or 0	<=

	and	1 or 0	conjunction
	or	1 or 0	disjunction
	not	1 or 0	negation

VIRTUAL MEMORY SEGMENTS
	the DracoVM manipulates various virtual memory segments
	these memory segments have pointers which have a constant address in virtual memory
	and can be used to access these segments

	ARG	arguments to the subroutine
	LOCAL	local variables for the subroutine
	STATIC	static variables which have a constant virtual memory address


ACCESSING MEMORY SEGMENTS:
	push 	SEGMENT index
	pop 	SEGMENT index


PROGRAM FLOW COMMANDS:
	label	SYMBOL  //globally unique label for jumping
	goto 	SYMBOL  //jump to a label specified earlier
