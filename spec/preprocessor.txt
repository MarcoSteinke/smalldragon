there are preprocessor directives,
allowing to include and or use other .dg sources

the preprocessor phase takes place before the cleaning and lexing phases
preprocessor directives are not part of the grammar
preprocessor statements are removed in the cleaning phase

PREPROCESSOR DIRECTIVES
use FILE		//reads the file into the list of sources to be compiled
