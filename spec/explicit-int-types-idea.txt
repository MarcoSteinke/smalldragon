Many programming languages
provide an 'int' which is signed.
this is easier to write than 'unsigned int' or 'uint32_t'.
Rust provides i32, u32 among others.

In my opinion it should be easy to write reagardless of the signed
or unsigned variety, and i prefer the rust way of writing it.

Smalldragon currently has 'UInt' and 'Int' among others.
This makes it easy to opt into the unsigned variety.
