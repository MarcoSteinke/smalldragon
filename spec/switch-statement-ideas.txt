A Switch Statement has some benefits 
as stated here: 
https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-a-switch-statement

In https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/wiki/Switch-Statements
it is described that cases should be able to be grouped,
but also that 'break' is frequently after a case.

So i wanted to be able to group cases but 
avoid the 'break' and still have a block with '{ ... }'
as it would be consistent with other control flow statements.

Below is the idea for a syntax for SwitchStmt in SmallDragon

// --------------------- 

x = 3;

switch x {

	case 0 {
		return 0;	
	}

	case 1
	case 2 
	case 3 { 
		main(); 
	}
	
	case NUM_GOOD
	case FELLOW_GOOD
	case ERROR_CASE
	case 7
	case NUM_SPECIAL 
	case NUM_PRESENT 
	case PRESET_FULL {
		
		sum(2,3);
	}
	
}

//----------------------

SwitchStmt ::= 'switch' Variable '{' CaseStmt* '}'

CaseStmt ::= 'case' (BoolConst | IntConst | CharConst) StmtBlock?
