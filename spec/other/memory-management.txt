Allocation/Freeing of Memory in SmallDragon 
should happen with 'malloc' and 'free'.

Memory will not be allocated on the stack.
This simplifies the implementation and allows
for more consistent C code to be generated.

There would be no extra branches
for various accesses to memory, as every 
non-primitive variable would be a pointer.

So it would always be 'myvar->' or 'myvar[...]'
