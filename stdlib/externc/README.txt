This contains files declaring externc functions
which are from libc, sdl or other c libraries.

The idea is to get up to speed quickly for the user without 
the need to create smalldragon 'externc' bindings for 
libc and other C libraries.

Not everything will be declared in these files,
as that would be a bunch of work.
The focus is on the stuff that is most frequently used.
