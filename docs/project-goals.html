<h1>SmallDragon Project Goals</h1>

<h3> Design Decisions and Reasoning behind them</h3>

<ul>
	<li> 
		<strong>hackable to the core </strong>
		<p>
		Make it your own. Everything in smalldragon
		is created with extendability and modularity in mind.
		The transpiler is composed of multiple small programs
		which can be used and modified independently.
		They communicate with easy-to-understand formats.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>no macros</strong>
		<p>
			I made this decision to simplify the parsing of code
			and also because it makes code easier to read,
			as there is nothing that's 'hidden' away in some macro.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>no effort for backwards compatibility </strong>
		<p>
			SmallDragon is a learning Project for me
			so anything might change whenever.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>no void</strong>
		<p>
			This simplifies the Language Grammar. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>strict evaluation</strong>
		<p>
			I chose strict evaluation over lazy evaluation because
			lazy evaluation is harder to reason about as a programmer, in my opinion.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>no user-defined prefix,infix or suffix operators</strong>
		<p>
			This greatly simplifies the parser.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>not a self-hosting transpiler</strong>
		<p>
			This simplifies development as there are many tools
			available for C development.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> no need to declare a namespace, methods and structs are top-level </strong>
		<p>
			In my opinion, it does not make sense to force unneccessary indentation
			on people. The name of the file is the namespace of a translation unit
			in smalldragon. structs and methods can be declared and defined directly,
			without needing a wrapper like a class or namespace construct.
			This also makes code easier to read without context.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> no unneccessary nesting of syntactic constructs </strong>
		<p>
			There are no nested method definitions or nested structures 
			in smalldragon. Indentation is limited to the minimum necessary.
			I have personally never seen a case where it was necessary or
			'better' in any way to declare a nested function or anything like that.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li> 
		<strong> simple syntax </strong>
		<p>
			SmallDragon provides the basic building blocks like loops and if-statements
			that are classics to most programming languages. Extra stuff like 
			annotations or bloated syntax is avoided whenever possible.
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3> Safety Goals </h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>no null/NULL/undefined</strong>
		<p>
			Having 'NULL' makes it hard to understand code without 
			context and knowledge of the code around it.
			Good code should make sense on it's own.
			So it should be obvious when a variable might not contain anything.
			So NULL will not be implemented in smalldragon.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>no global state</strong>
		<p>
			SmallDragon has no ability to declare any global variables.
			Everything is (currently) either inside a struct or method.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>no uninitialized variables</strong>
		<p>
			This feature is not complete yet. 
			It would be desireable to let the transpiler figure
			out if a given variable can be proven to have been assigned to
			before usage. This should also be true for struct members.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> dependently typed primitive variables </strong>
		<p>
			Properties of primitive variables should be 
			propagated throughout the code so we can use
			static assertions to safeguard our code against faulty 
			values at compile-time. This exciting feature is waiting 
			for a concept for implementation currently.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> pure functions and impure methods explicit </strong>
		<p>
			A function declared pure should not contain calls to 
			impure methods. Purity of a subroutine should be 
			checked by the transpiler. 
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3> Tools/Ecosystem Goals</h3>
