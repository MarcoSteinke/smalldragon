goal is to create a subroutine to print
a 32 bit integer to stdout.

dragon (at time of writing) only has a builtin
'putchar' subroutine and a 'putdigit' subroutine, the printing of integers
is implemented in the stdlib.

we want to change it by implementing 'puti' in assembly,
then removing 'putdigit'
