[ ] make a vm command to print a register dump to the console
[ ] make a vm command to print a stack dump to the console
[ ] make a dracovm code verifier, which checks that for every branch of execution in every subroutine, there amount left on the stack at the end is the correct amount. 
[ ] maybe implement the primitive "Anything" Type. this would be helpful for implementing various subroutines that operate on arrays. i could implement a builtin 
    subroutine "arrlen" that would determine the length of any arrays (arrays should be length-prefixed in dragon).
    ...
    thinking about "Anything" Type, what if we shorten that to "*" and it looks even cooler with Type Constraints.
    Like "public Int print((* implements IShow) item){...}".
